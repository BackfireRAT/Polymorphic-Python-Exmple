# Polymorphic-Python-Exmple

Polymorphic Code is code that changes everytime it's executed. This is an example of how that would work. In order for this code to operate
like a virus would, you would need to have it output the same name and delete the original. Also, this code just outputs the morphed code,
it doesnt actually do anything malicious. Hope you can make use of it.
